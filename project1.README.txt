Project 1

The game is essentially a vertical scrolling game. The premise behind the game is that you are in the
ocean: you fall from the surface and try to reach the bottom without hitting any of the fish (which are
currently just a bunch of boxes). The point is to make it to the bottom without dying. 
You can move the player within a set of bounded area within the screen. You have three lives, and a life 
is lost when you hit an enemy. Your score is equivalent to your "depth" as well as an extra 300 points per
life you win the game with. 

CONTROLS: W A S D
